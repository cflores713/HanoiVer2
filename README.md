The traditional rules for the Tower of Hanoi still stand: Each disc has a diameter that is larger than the discs above it on the stack. You can only move one disc at a time, you can only move a smaller disc onto a stack with larger discs. and you can only move discs by using edges in the directed graph.

More details can be found in the Analysis Report that is the pdf file included in this repository.
